You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Further information

`CodeBook.md` includes information describing the variables, how the code works, and how the data was obtained
`run_analysis.R` includes the relevant code that can be run as long as the Samsung data is in your working directory
`tidy_dataset.txt` is the tidied final data after going through all the steps decribed in the Assignment section above
