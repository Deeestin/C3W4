#### Code Book

## Data was obtained from the following sources:
* http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
* https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
  
This code book summarizes the resulting data fields in `tidy_data.txt`.

## Identifiers

* `subject` - The ID of the test subject
* `activity` - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken

## Used datasets of the original zip file linked in ReadMe.md

* `'features_info.txt'`
* `'features.txt'`
* `'activity_labels.txt'`
* `'train/x_train.txt'`
* `'train/y_train.txt'`
* `'test/x_test.txt'`
* `'test/y_test.txt'`
* `'train/subject_train.txt'`
* `test/subject_test.txt`

## Activity Labels

* `WALKING` (`1`): walked
* `WALKING_UPSTAIRS` (`2`): walked up staircase 
* `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS` (`3`): walked down staircase 
* `SITTING` (`4`): sitting 
* `STANDING` (`5`): standing 
* `LAYING` (`6`): laying down 


## Steps

# Download the dataset

# Assign each data to variables

# Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
X (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging x_train and x_test (by using rbind() function)
Y (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging y_train and y_test (by using rbind() function)
Subject (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test (by using rbind() function)
Merged_Data (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging Subject, Y and X (by using cbind() function)

# Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
TidyData (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting Merged_Data, selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

# Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Entire numbers in code column of the TidyData replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable

# Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
code column in TidyData renamed into activities
All `Acc` in columnâ€™s name replaced by `Accelerometer`, `Gyro` replaced by `Gyroscope`, `BodyBody` replaced by `Body`, `Mag` replaced by `Magnitude`, `f` replaced by `Frequency`, and `t` replaced by `Time`

# Creating an independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
Tidy dataset can be found as `tidy_dataset` in repo
